<p>This list has been closed since tasks are now managed with the PyGreSQL
tracker that can be found at <a class="reference external" href="http://trac.vex.net:8000/pgtracker">http://trac.vex.net:8000/pgtracker</a>.
(ticket numbers have been added below):</p>
<div class="section" id="to-do">
<h1>To Do</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add docs for the pgdb module (everything specific to PyGreSQL) (#5).</li>
<li>The large object and direct access functions need much more attention (#6).</li>
<li>The fetch method should use real cursors (#7).</li>
<li>The C module needs to be cleaned up and redundant code merged,
and should get its own unit test module (#8).</li>
<li>Clean up test_pg.py and merge it with TEST_PyGreSQL_classic.py (#9).</li>
<li>The test suite for the classic module should also check that quoted
mixed-case identifiers can be used everywhere - currently they can't.
Improve pg.py accordingly, adding quotes etc. as needed (#10).</li>
<li>What shall we do with the &quot;tutorial&quot; directory - it's rather a tutorial
for Postgres/SQL than for PyGreSQL, it's using only the query method from
the classic pg module and no other PyGreSQL functionality, it's rather
a demo than a tutorial (#11)?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wish-list">
<h1>Wish List</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make use of PQexecParams() and PQprepare(). This could speed up
executemany() and allow retrieving binary data directly by setting
the resultFormat parameter to one (#16).</li>
<li>Enhance cursor.description attribute, delivering more information
available with PQfmod() or PQftable() for instance (#17).</li>
<li>Support optional &quot;errorhandler&quot; extension (#18).</li>
<li>Support optional cursor and connection attribute &quot;messages&quot; (#19).</li>
<li>Users should be able to register their own types with _pg (#21).</li>
<li>pg has now got a new method namedresult() that returns named tuples.
pgdb should also support named tuples, maybe via a row_factory attribute
on the connection, similar to sqlite3 (see #22).</li>
<li>New methods in the classic module, similar to getresult() and
dictresult(), but returning dictionaries of rows instead of lists
of rows (with primary key or oids as keys) (#23).</li>
<li>Make PyGreSQL thread-safe on the connection level (#24).</li>
<li>The API documentation could be created with Epydoc or Sphinx (#4).</li>
<li>Write a tutorial for beginners and advanced use (#11).</li>
<li>More and better documented examples (#4, #5, #11).</li>
</ul>
